## Overview

![simp-packer basics][simp-packer-basics]

* This version of `simp-packer` supports SIMP >= 6.5.0-Alpha
* It builds Vagrant boxes for [Virtualbox][virtualbox] using Vagrant's
  [virtualbox-iso][vagrant-virtualbox-iso] builder.
* See the [Roadmap](#roadmap) for boxes/features that are currently implemented
  and planned.

[simp-packer-basics]: assets/simp-packer-basics.png

## Setup

Requirements:

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
* [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads.html) (distributed as a binary).

  - Ensure the binary is in your `$PATH` and comes before any other packer
    executables on the system (e.g., `export PATH="/path/to/packer:$PATH"`).
  - `simp-packer` >= 2.4  requires `packer` version 1.4.0  or later.
    It also requires ruby 2.3.0 or later because of gem dependencies.


* A [SIMP][SIMP] ISO (`.iso`) file. Either an official release or one generated
  by [simp-core](https://github.com/simp/simp-core) build commands.
  * _(Optional, but useful:)_ The `.json` "vars" file that was generated along
    with the SIMP `.iso` file. This file is generated by the SIMP ISO build
    process.


## Usage

There are a few ways to run simp-packer:

1. [Using `rake simp:packer:matrix`](#using-rake-simppackermatrix)

   - still under development and has not been thoroughly tested.
   - Builds multiple Vagrant boxes based on a matrix of settings.
   - Publishes each box plus JSON files with **_versioned_** metadata to
     a local directory tree.
     - Beaker, `Vagrantfile`s, and `vagrant init` can use this JSON metadata to
       request specific boxes and alert when a new version of a box is
       available.

2. [Using `rake simp:packer:build`](#using-rake-simppackerbuild-and-rake-simppackeroldbuild)

   - Builds a single Vagrant box, _without_ any version metadata.
   - Requires you to [manually provide a test directory and configuration
     files](#manually-creating-the-configuration-files)

3. [Using `rake simp:packer:oldbuild`](#using-rake-simppackerbuild-and-rake-simppackeroldbuild)

   - Takes a test directory that has the `vars.json`, `packer.yaml` and
     `simp_conf.yaml` already set up like the old build process.

All methods are configured by [environment variables](#environment-variables)
and Rake task arguments.

IMPORTANT:
  Packer` uses around twice the space of the virtual image footprint when
  building, so ensure that `TMPDIR` has sufficient space.  `TMPDIR` defaults to
  `/tmp` which is not (usually) large enough.  This affects all methods.

### Using `rake simp:packer:matrix`

Often, it is desirable to build several 'flavors' of simp-packer boxes at the
same time. A rake task, `simp:packer:matrix` has been provided for this purpose:

```sh
TMPDIR=/some/tmp/dir \
  [ENV_VAR=value ...] \
  bundle exec rake simp:packer:matrix[MATRIX_ELEMENTS ...]
```

A typical example would look like:

```sh
TMPDIR="$PWD/tmp" \
  MATRIX_LABEL=build_6.2.0RC1_ \
  VAGRANT_BOX_DIR="$PATH_TO_VAGRANT_BOX_TREE" \
  SIMP_ISO_JSON_FILES='${PATH_TO_ISO_JSON_FILES}/SIMP-6.2.0-0.el*.json' \
  bundle exec rake simp:packer:matrix[os=el6:el7,fips=on:off]
```

Assuming the glob `${PATH_TO_ISO_JSON_FILES}/SIMP-6.2.0-0.el*.json` matched two
files (one for `el6` and one for `el7`), this would result in four back-to-back
simp-packer builds:

* (`os=el6`, `fips=on`)  SIMP-6.2.0-0.el6 with FIPS mode enabled
* (`os=el7`, `fips=on`)   SIMP-6.2.0-0.el7 with FIPS mode enabled
* (`os=el6`, `fips=off`) SIMP-6.2.0-0.el6 with FIPS mode disabled
* (`os=el7`, `fips=off`) SIMP-6.2.0-0.el7 with FIPS mode disabled


#### Build matrix elements

Build matrix elements are delimited by colons (`:`)

| Matrix args   | Supported   | Default   |  Description                                   |
| ------------- | :-------:   | :-----:   | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `os=`         | `el6:el7`   | `el6:el7` | OSes to include in the matrix.  JSON files **will be filtered out** if their data doesn't match one of these OSes. |
| `fips=`       | `on:off`    | `on`      |  Build SIMP Vagrant box with FIPS mode enabled |
| `encryption=` | `on:off`    | `off`     |  Build SIMP Vagrant box with disk encryption   |
| `firmware=`   | `bios:efi   | `bios`    |  Defines which firmware base to use            |
| `json=`       | _filepaths_ | N/A       | _(optional, if `SIMP_ISO_JSON_FILES` is set)_ List of absolute paths/globs to SIMP ISO `.json` files to consider |


**NOTE:** `.json` files (specified by `json=` and/or the environment variable
`SIMP_ISO_JSON_FILES`) are _filtered_ based on whether their data matches the
`os=` matrix argument.

* If `os=el6` and the glob `${PATH_TO_ISO_JSON_FILES}/SIMP-6.2.0-0.el*.json`
  matched two files (one with data for `el6` and one for `el7`), only the file
  with data for `el6` would be included in the matrix (and the `el7` file would
  not be used).
* If `os=el6:el7` and the glob
  `${PATH_TO_ISO_JSON_FILES}/SIMP-6.2.0-0.el*.json` matched two files (one with
  data for `el6` and one for `el7`), only the file with data for `el6` would be
  included in the matrixâ€”and the `el7` file would not be used.


#### Environment variables for build matrices

| Environment variable  | Description                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `VAGRANT_BOX_DIR`     | Path to top of Vagrant box tree |
| `SIMP_ISO_JSON_FILES` | List of absolute paths/globs to SIMP ISO `.json` files to consider (delimiters: `:`, `,`).  This variable can be used as an alternative to the matrix entry `json=`.  Non-existent paths will be discarded with a warning message |
| `MATRIX_LABEL`        | Label for this matrix run that will prefix each iteration's directory name (default: `build_<YYYYmmdd>_<HHMMSS>`) |


### Using `rake simp:packer:build` and `rake simp:packer:oldbuild`


```sh
TMPDIR=/some/tmp/dir \
  [ENV_VAR=value ...] \
  bundle exec rake simp:packer:build[vars_json,packer_yaml,simp_conf_yaml,test_dir]
```

```sh
TMPDIR=/some/tmp/dir \
  [ENV_VAR=value ...] \
  bundle exec rake simp:packer:oldbuild[test_dir]
```


The `build` version allows you to call using configuration files located from
other locations. You don't copy the config files to the test directory.
It will copy the files over for you but you have to type in all the locations.

The `oldbuild` versions allows you copy the files to a directory your self and run
just entering the directory.

- Both of these tasks create a single Vagrant box _without version
  metadata_.


#### Manually creating the configuration files

Create a **test directory**, and include the following files:

* `vars.json`:  The JSON file that describes SIMP ISO.  The simp-core task
  `rake build:auto` creates a version of this file along with each SIMP ISO.
  It contains  information like the ISO path, the ISO checksum, the name of the
  distribution ISO, and the `root` password. Samples can be found in
  `samples/<sample>/vars.json`.
* `simp_conf.yaml`:  YAML generated by `simp config`.  You can use a copy of
  one from a previous build or edit one from from
  `samples/<sample>/simp_conf.yaml`. Puppet server and FIPS configurations will
  be overridden by settings from the build and matrix and `packer.yaml`.
* `packer.yaml`:  Overrides build defaults.  `simp-packer` requires this file
  (even if you don't want to override defaults). Samples can be found in
  `samples/<sample>/packer.yaml`.  For CentOS 6 builds, you **MUST** change the
  `nat_interface` and `host_only_interface` to `eth0` and `eth1`, respectively.

See [samples/README.md](samples/README.md) for more information.


### Output file locations

- A **working directory** will be created under the test directory, where all the
  scripts, manifests, and files are kept.
- A time-stamped **log file** is created in the top level of the test directory and
  all the log output from `packer` is copied there. If the `packer` build
  fails, it is renamed from `<date>.log` to `<date>.log.errors`.
- A **Vagrant box file** (`*.box`) with its `Vagrantfile` and `Vagrantfile.erb`
  will be located in the directory defined by the `packer.yaml file`
  `output_directory` (default is `<testdirectory>/OUTPUT`).


### Environment variables

* The [Environment Variables for Packer][packer-env-vars] are useful to customize builds.
* Other important variables:

| Variable                     | Description |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| [**`TMPDIR`**][TMPDIR]       | This is a POSIX environment variable that is often **critical to set** when running packer: the directory _must_ be able to store over 4GB as the box is being built.  The default location is `/tmp`, which on many systems is unable to store that much data. |
| **`EXTRA_SIMP_PACKER_ARGS`** | Extra CLI arguments when running `packer build` |
| **`SIMP_PACKER_verbose`**    |  When `yes`, some simp-packer logic produces more detailed output (default: `no`).|

### The Packer file

The packer file is generated from the file `templates/simp.json.erb and settings from
the packer.yaml file.

#### Build Section

- Installs the ISO
- Adds the `vagrant` user
- Sets umask for `root`
- Configures the network to start up a boot time
- Changes the passwords for `simp` and `root`
- Updates the `sudoers` file so `simp` user can sudo without a password and
  without a tty

#### Provisioning Section

Runs a suite of configurations and tests while packer is provisioning the new
box:

Configurations:

- Checks that FIPS was enabled/disabled per configuration.
- Runs `simp config` and `simp bootstrap`.
- Installs a manifest that configures the `vagrant` user so you can `vagrant
  ssh` once the box is built, configures `simp` user so `packer` can continue
  working
- Reboots and runs Puppet a couple of times.

Tests:

- Ensures that the build of the puppetserver is successful and the puppetserver
  is up and running and listening on the ports configured in `simp_conf.yaml`.
- Verifies that FIPS is setting match across the `simp_conf.yaml`, the
  `simp_config_settings.yaml` and the operational environment.
- Checks that selinux is set to `enforcing` (the default for simp.)
- If `simp_crypt_disk` is used in the `simp.conf`, it verifies that the disk is
  encrypted.
- Verifies that `/`, `/var/`,`/var/audit` are separate partitions.
- Checks that the port in `puppet.conf` file matches the port in
  `simp_conf.yaml`


##### The `simpsetup::` Puppet module

After the tests pass, `simp-packer` configures the Puppet by running `puppet
apply` on the `simpsetup` module is applied using `puppet apply`.  It is run
once so that if you make changes later on they are not overwritten. This module
does the following:

- Sets up the kickstart files
- Sets up DNS
- Sets up TFTP manifests
- Runs the FakeCA `togen` script to generate SIMP application certificates for
  the SIMP server and all the clients pre-configured in DHCP and DNS.
- Adds users and groups into LDAP
- Sets up autosign to be `*.<domain name>`, so kickstarted systems will get
  their Puppet certificates autosigned.
- Runs scripts that edit the `site.pp` file to create some hostgroups and the
  SIMP server's hiera file to include kickstart and tftpboot classes.
- Copies into the `site` module, but does not use, other useful manifests site
  such as `workstation.pp` and `nfs.pp`.  These manifests will be refined as
  the test suite is expanded.
- Runs puppet once more

The post-processor then exports the VirtualBox to a Vagrant box and removes the
output directory.


### The Vagrantfile

- The `vagrant` user's SSH password is `vagrant`.
- The Vagrantfile is not wrapped in the Vagrant `.box`, so the network
  settings can be seen. Vagrant is not easily configured to check if a vbox
  hostonly network exists; you will have to ensure the network exists before
  running `vagrant up`.
- You can change the network name in the Vagrant file.
- The Vagrantfile does not configure the machine to _use_ its IP address.
  You can turn it on, but changing the IP address will mess up the puppet
  server.
- [Synced folders][vagrant-synced-folders] are disabled.


### Default SIMP server environment

- The Puppet server's IP will be `X.X.X.7`
- DHCP and DNS are pre-populated with entries for `server21.domain.name`
  through `server29.domain.name`, and `ws31.domain.name` to `ws39.domain.name`.
  - Each host's IP and MAC will match the hostname's number: e.g., `server21`
    will have the IP `X.X.X.21` and the MAC address `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:21`.
- The default password for the `root` and `simp` user accounts is
  `P@ssw0rdP@ssw0rd`.
  - You can override this in `vars.json` by setting `new_password`.
  - At this time, there is no mechanism to change the LDAP Password.
- The SIMP server is configured to be an LDAP server:
  - The `basedn` will match the `packer.yaml`'s `domain` (or use the default).
  - Basic LDAP users are included: `user1`, `user2`, `admin1`, `admin2`
    - `admin1` and `admin2` are in the `administrators` group.
- The default distribution's ISO path is `/net/ISO/Distribution_ISOs`. This is
  currently hard-coded in `simp.json.erb`.

### Troubleshooting & common problems

#### Building the boxes

##### `fatal error: runtime: out of memory`

This error is generally encountered during the OS ISO upload, and it means what it
says: the host machine that is building the VM has run out of available RAM

**Characteristic log snippet:**

```

```


##### `Post-processor failed:` ... `no space left on device`

`simp_config.rb` configures the vagrant post-processor to write the `.box` file
into the `<testingdirectory>/OUTPUT` directory, or the path of
`output_directory` if it is defined by the `packer.yaml` file.  If this
location does not have the capacity to hold the box while it is being
constructed, it will fail.

**Characteristic log snippet:**

```

## Development

### Contributing to `simp-packer`

Please read our [Contribution Guide][simp-contrib].

If you find any issues, they can be submitted to our [JIRA][simp-jira].

To see a list of development-related tasks available for this project, run:

      bundle exec rake -T

### Travis pipeline

**Validation:**

* Ruby code is linted with [rubocop][rubocop], using `bundle exec rake
  test:rubocup`.
* Shell scripts are linted with [shellcheck][shellcheck], using `bundle exec
  test:shellcheck`.
  * _(The `shellcheck` binary is is now built into Travis CI environments, even
    for `language: ruby`!)_
  * **NOTE:** The version of `shellcheck` on Travis CI may be different than
    your local development environment.  In particular, the EL7 EPEL `ShellCheck`
    package is much older (0.35 vs 0.45+)â€”in practice, this has generally
    meant that `shellcheck` in Travis CI catches more nuanced errors.
* Puppet code and metadata is linted as part of the
  `test:puppet` rake task.  At the moment, only Puppet code  under
  `puppet/modules/` is linted.

**Puppet (SIMP versions):**

* All Puppet modules under the `puppet/modules/` directory will be tested
  using `bundle exec rake test:puppet`.
* The Travis CI pipeline matrix only considers the versions of Puppet used in
  SIMP along with the latest 5.x (which is informational, and allowed to fail).


## Roadmap

### Box roles

simp-packer is intended to create a family of different SIMP box configurations
to support automated integration tests for the entire [SIMP Pre-Release
checklist][simp-prerel-checklist] _(requires [SIMP-5238][SIMP-5238])_:

![simp-packer roadmap](assets/simp-packer-box-roadmap.png)

The following family of box roles can be used to automate integration tests for
an ISO-based SIMP release:

- [x] **`simp-server`** â€” a freshly-installed SIMP server, with `simp config` and `simp bootstrap` already applied
- [ ] **`simp-server-noconfig`** â€” a freshly-install `simp-server`, but _before_ running `simp config`
- [ ] **`empty`** â€” a completely [empty vagrant box][empty-vagrant-box], used to test PXE boots and kickstarts
- [ ] **`simp-client`** â€” a pre-seeded SIMP client
- [ ] **`simp-wsclient`** â€” a pre-seeded SIMP workstation client
- [ ] **`linux-min`** â€” a SIMP installation using the `linux-min` boot option

Non-ISO installations can be also be configured and tested, and they would be
able to re-use most of the Beaker suites designed for use with the
`simp-server` box role in [simp-integration_tests][simp-integration_tests].

- [ ] Alternative `simp-server` boxes:
  - [ ] **`yumbuilt-simp-server`** â€” a freshly-installed SIMP server, built
    from a fresh OS install using the [Installing SIMP From A
    Repository][simp-doc-install-from-repo] procedure.
  - [ ] **`r10kbuilt-simp-server`** â€” a freshly-installed SIMP server, built
    from a fresh OS install using the [r10k/Code Manager
    Installation][simp-doc-install-from-r10k] procedure.


### Documentation

- [x] Verify documentation
- [x] Environment Variables
- [ ] The purpose of simp-packer
- [x] Contribution/Development
- [ ] Roadmap


### Tests

- [x] Asset tests _(phase 1â€”low-hanging fruit)_:
  - [x] [Shellcheck][shellcheck] to lint shell scripts
  - [x] [Rubocop][rubocop] to lint ruby scripts
  - [x] Local Puppet module tests: syntax validation, lint checks, and spec
  - [x] All asset tests should be run from rake tasks
  - [x] Update the Travis CI pipeline to run asset tests
- [ ] Asset tests _(phase 2â€”more complete)_:
  - [ ] Tests (at least linting) for any non-module puppet manifests?
  - [x] Validate `simp.json.erb` creates a parseable JSON file
  - [ ] Validate `simp.json` using the [packer JSON _schema_][packer-schema]
  - [x] Spec tests for ruby code (after refactoring into testable components)
        under `lib/`)
  - [ ] Update the GitLab CI pipeline to run asset tests
    - `test:shellcheck` will need a `shellcheck`-capable CI Runner
- [ ] Integration tests during `packer build`:
  - [ ] Test if the SIMP server's YUM repos are setup and working. These are
    the repos the SIMP clients are configured to use.
  - [ ] Check if puppet is actually running on the port you specified using
    `netstat` or `ss`.
  - [ ] Add one last puppet run in at the end and check that it returns 0.
    Since all services including DNS should be set up, nothing should change at
    that point.)


### Features

- [ ] Compose `simp-packer.json` from JSON snippets ([SIMP-5238][SIMP-5238])
- [x] Move the packer build into a rake task
- [x] Support move to Hiera 5 when building SIMP 6.3+ boxes:
  - [x] New system installs for SIMP >= 6.3+ use Hiera 5
  - [x] New system installs for SIMP <= 6.2.x must still use Hiera 3
- [x] `simp:packer:matrix` matrix build
- [x] Refactor reusable host-side ruby code into a `lib/` directory
- [ ] Add an Environment variable in to allow it to create the box, even if tests
      fail.
- [ ] Kickstart a client to go with the box _(see: [Box roles](#box-roles))_
- [x] Make the location of the distribution ISO configurable.  ~~Right now it is
      hard-coded to be `/net/ISO/Distribution_ISOs`~~ _(Now provided by
      `vars.json` > `iso_url`)_
- [ ] Validate input from `packer.yaml`
- [ ] Don't fail if `packer.yaml` doesn't exist (it should be able to run with
      all the defaults).
- [x] Save version metadata for a `.box` file in Vagrant Cloud API format
     (`rake vagrant:json`)
- [ ] Scaffold and maintain a local Vagrant box directory tree of `.box` and
  `.json` version metadata files.  The `.json` files must be consumable by
  local `vagrant init` and `vagrant up` commands.
     - [x] ~~Scaffold tree~~ (`rake vagrant:publish:local`)
     - [x] ~~Add boxes to tree~~ (`rake vagrant:publish:local`)
     - [ ] Remove boxes from tree
     - [x] ~~List boxes in tree~~ (`rake vagrant:tree:list`)
     - [ ] Find/search boxes in tree
     - [ ] Refresh top-level box metadata to include all versions of each box
     - [ ] Prune older box versions from tree

### Cleanup

- [ ] Restructure project to place puppet code in one place, ruby another, etc
  - [x] ruby
    - [x] rake tasks
    - [x] simp_config.rb
  - [ ] puppet
    - [x] modules
    - [ ] right now some Puppet code is embedded as bash heredocs
- [ ] Change the `packer.yaml` settings to match the names used in the
  `simp.json` file to make things more consistent and will allow code
  simplification.
- [x] Merge the `simp_config.rb` and `simp_packer_tests.sh` into one ruby
  script and clean it up.
- [ ] Delete the Virtualbox host-only network if we created it
- [x] `rake clean` should delete symlinks that will break packer.
- [x] Fix builds from SIMP-6.1.0-0 ISOs

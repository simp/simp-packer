    - Shell scripts are linted by shellcheck.
    - Ruby code is linted by rubocop.
    - Added spec tests to the `simpsetup` Puppet module
  - Restructured puppet code:
    - Puppet code is now under `puppet/modules/` and `puppet/profiles/`.
    - Added module metadata and development files to `simpsetup`.
    - Unused manifest files have been given the suffix `.UNUSED`.
  - Added `rakelib/` directory for rake tasks
  - Added `lib/` directory for ruby code (prep for spec tests)

- README love:
  - Restructured and expanded documentation;
  - Added a diagram of the basic workflow and directory structure.
  - Added a troubleshooting section.
  - Converted `samples/README` to markdown and linked from the top-level

- Cleaned up `simp.json.template`
  - Added RHEL support, new variables, minor fixes for bugs and logic

    use JavaScript syntax highlighting rules to correctly render the whole file.

- Added Rake tasks.  Notable examples:
  - `bundle exec rake test`: Runs all tests
  - `bundle exec rake clean`: Removes packer-breaking symlinks and fixtures
  - `bundle exec rake vagrant:boxname[]`: (experimental) Generates a JSON file
    that Vagrantfiles and beaker nodesets can use to compare box versions

Wed Jul 11 2018 Jeanne Greulich <jeanne.greulich@onyxpoint.com> - 2.0.0-0
- Removed old code and moved simp-testing to the main directory

Wed Mar 14 2018 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 0.1.0-0
- simp-testing updates:
  - Added ability to set root's umask prior to running 'simp config'.
    This allows testing of the fix to the SIMP 6.1.0 problem in which
    SIMP failed to bootstrap on a system on which root's umask has
    already been restricted to 077.
  - Added tests to verify that the  puppetserver and puppetdb services
    are running after SIMP is bootstrapped.
  - Minor code refactor/documentation updates.
  - Checked in more example configurations.

Tue Jun 27 2017 Jeanne Greulich <jeanne.greulich@onyxpoint.com> 0.1.0-0
- Created functioning tests and infrastructure to run them in simp-testing/.
  When the tests succeed a bootstrapped, SIMP vbox is created.

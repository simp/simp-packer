Each test directory should contain 3 files:

simp_conf.yaml:
YAML file generated by simp-cli in /home/root/.simp when 'simp config'
is run.  This is the basis for the simp_conf.yaml file that will be
input to 'simp config' during the provisioning of the SIMP system.
Note that the following settings in that file will be overwritten with
values determined from packer.yaml settings:
    cli::network::gateway
    cli::network::hostname
    cli::network::interface
    cli::network::ipaddress
    cli::network::netmask
    simp_options::fips
    simp_options::dns::search
    simp_options::dns::servers
    simp_options::ldap::base_dn
    simp_options::ntpd::servers
    simp_options::puppet::server
    simp_options::puppet::ca
    simp_options::trusted_nets

vars.json:
JSON file generated by the ISO build.  It points to the location of
the ISO, the checksum and the name of the distribution ISO.  (The
output directory and password from here are ignored at this time. They
are overwritten by the defaults.)

packer.yaml:
YAML file with provisioning overrides.  Each provisioning override
(listed below) has a default value that will applied if the tag is
present in this YAML.  However, even if no custom values are to be
specified, this file must be present.

The defaults are set in simp_config.rb and all values are strings.
At this time, no validation of values is done.

Provisioning Overrides:

# The name/description of the machine.  It is used to create files and
# directories, so use only letters, numbers, '-', ',' or '_'.
VM_DESCRIPTION: 'SIMP-PACKER-BUILD'

# Fully qualified path to the directory you want to place your output.
# The system will create a timestamp directory in here to place
# the data because it fails if the directory exists.
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY: '/var/user1/OUTPUT'

# The NAT interface that is used by vagrant.
# It must be the first interface
# On Centos 6 it should be eth0, on CentOS 7 enp0s3 works in most cases
# NOTE:  the MAC for this interface is auto-generated.
NAT_INTERFACE: 'enp0s3'

# The next 4 parameters pertain to configuration of the host-only interface.
# The machine will have a second interface for a host-only VirtualBox network.
# This network must already be setup on your system before you run this
# packer build.  The packer build will NOT create it for you.
# This host-only network must be a class C IPv4 network, currently, because
# 1) the netmask is hardcoded to 255.255.255.0
# 2) the puppet master IP is created by taking the first three octets of
#    the gateway address and adding .7
# 3) the DHCP and DNS configurations are created for a set of workstations
#    and servers whose IPs are in the range [first three octets + .20] to
     [first three octets + .39]

# The interface used on the system for the host-only network
# CentOS 6 it should be 'eth1', on CentOS 7 enp0s8 works in most cases
HOST_ONLY_INTERFACE: 'enp0s8'

# The MAC address of the host-only interface.
# The MAC addresses for the set of servers and workstations in the
# generated DHCP configuration are comprised of the first 10 characters
# (hex #s) of this MAC address plus the numbers 21 - 39.
MACADDRESS: 'aabbbbaa0007'

# The gateway is the router address.  It will check if you have
# a virtualbox network with this gateway and if not create one.
#(It does not delete it when finished at this time.)
HOST_ONLY_GATEWAY: '192.168.101.1'


# Domain to which the host belongs.  Will be used to set server's network domain
# and FQDN.
DOMAIN: 'simp.test'

# Host name of the server, will be appended to DOMAIN for full name.
PUPPETNAME': 'puppet',

# This will be the password for the root, simp and LDAP root.
#  (new_password in the vars.json file is ignored.)
# FIXME: This doesn't work for the LDAP root password, at this time (sorry)
NEW_PASSWORD: 'P@ssw0rdP@ssw0rd',

# Whether to set up the system with fips
# Default is 'fips=0' which turns fips off.
FIPS: 'fips=1'

# Whether to encrypt the disk at build time
# Valid values:
#   '' to not encrypt
#  'simp_crypt_disk' or 'simp_disk_crypt' to encrypt the disk
#  This is used in diskdetect script in the ks directory.
DISK_CRYPT: ''

# Additional sleep to add to the time allotted to boot from the ISO.
# You may need to customize this if your build environment runs slower
# than than the environment used to develop this packer build & test
# capability. Should be a sequence of <wait10> strings (10 second wait
# commands allowed by packer).
#
# NOTE:
# (1) You need to use double quotes around the value if it contains one
#     or more <wait10> strings. Packer will fail with a keyboard input
#     error if you use single quotes.
# (2) The default is '', no extra time.
BIG_SLEEP: "<wait10><wait10><wait10>"

# The value of root's umask, set in /root/.bash_profile prior to simp config.
# Setting this to '0077' tests that SIMP can be bootstrapped when the
# SIMP host has this lockdown already in place.  A value of '' leaves
# the umask unchanged.
ROOT_UMASK: '0077'
